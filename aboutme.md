As an analytics consultant, I help companies create data solutions that create an impact.

### My Approach

With a background in Computer Science, I bring more than seven years of experience designing and implementing data solutions. I truly believe in the potential of data driven applications and their capability to transform the world.

### End-to-End Design Process
A data transformation initiative takes significant time commitment and financial resources but often with unsure results. By using a well defined process to understand the business needs, I try to implement a drive-train approach to implementing data transformation projects. Using latest tools and methodolgies, it is possible to uncover valuable insights that actually help the decision makers.
