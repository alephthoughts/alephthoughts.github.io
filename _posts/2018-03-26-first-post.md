Welcome to my blog!

This is the medium I will use to share my thoughts on many things that I find interesting. I have a buzzing mind which makes it hard for me to focus on one thing at a time. So I decided to name this blog after something that describes the state of my mind. How many thoughts at once do I have in my head?, I asked myself. My mind drifted to another question, What is the biggest number?
It turns out the largest number is a **_[geoglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoglyph)_**, "40" made of trees in Russia covering an area of 12000 square meters. 40Thoughts didn't sound cool enough to me, so my search continued. A **_[GoogolThoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol)_** or **_[GoogolplexThoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex)_** are big cardinal numbers but I wanted something bigger. So I named this blog after the smallest infinity which is denoted by the first Hebrew letter **_["Aleph"](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_null)_**. 
This place is going to be about cool stuff, and Numbers are cool! 
Cheers!!
